## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: ML core!
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for data exploration.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- **Other tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab (for experimentation).

---

## Strategy

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gather data from Kaggle & OpenML.
   - Clean, preprocess, and engineer features relevant to depression prediction.

2. **Model Development**
   - Evaluate different machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, deep learning).
   - Tune hyperparameters and validate models for accuracy and interpretability.

3. **Visualization**
   - Build dashboards to visualize depression rates and trends.
   - Enable users to input new data points and receive instant predictions (aka Inference)
